## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A professional blue (#2563EB) evoking trust and stability. This choice steers clear of trendiness, aiming for an enduring appeal, suitable for an educational context.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB) for a clean, neutral backdrop, minimizing distractions and focusing attention on the content.
- Accent color: A subtle and desaturated blue (#60A5FA) to complement the primary, used sparingly for interactive elements and key highlights without overwhelming the user.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable, and clean appearance across all text elements.
- Lucide-react icons for alerts and other visual cues to improve clarity and enhance the user experience.
- Maintain consistent spacing (4/8/12/16/24px increments) for a balanced and orderly layout.
- Subtle animations and transitions (Framer Motion) for interactive elements to enhance user experience.
